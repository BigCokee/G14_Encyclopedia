Our project is an interactive projection installation of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Since we got datasets from the National Library of Scotland, and found that it has 8 editions of 195 volumes, which is difficult for people to find information they need. For the sake of enhancing the Encyclopaedia Britannica’s readability, interactivity and enjoyment, we try to find specific relationships in it and use creative methods to immerse audiences in reading. In this report, we first explain how we analyse, clean and visualise data, in order to narrow down our theme. Then describe rationale for choice of the visualisation and interaction’s form. Finally, it will demonstrate the technique we used to turn our idea into reality and reflection of how we can improve our installation.
