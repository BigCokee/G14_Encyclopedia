Our project is an interactive projection installation of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Since we got datasets from the National Library of Scotland, and found that it has 8 editions of 195 volumes, which is difficult for people to find information they need. For the sake of enhancing the Encyclopaedia Britannica’s readability, interactivity and enjoyment, we try to find specific relationships in it and use creative methods to immerse audiences in reading.

The encyclopedia text data analysis is in **`./G14_Encyclopedia_V1-V8_Visualization`** (including the pre-preparation description of the function library to be installed)
All the original data are in: `./Encyclopedia Britannica V1-V8`
The realization process of "Touching the Encyclopaedia" interactive device is in: `/Interactive Board` and visualization library `/Dynamic effect_AE`
